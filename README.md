# infinite-tictactoe

Infinite tictactoe(5 in a row) where the board has a initialized size and it expands when needed so that there is always 3 empty rows and columns on each side.

Originally made with react-redux(https://github.com/valdoschl/tictactoe-infinite-react-redux) for web applications course homework to practice react and redux.

This is a remake with vanilla JS to make code more cleaner.
